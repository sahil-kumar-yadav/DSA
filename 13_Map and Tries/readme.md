# Map

Map stores unique key-value pairs in a sorted manner. Each key is uniquely associated with a value that may or may not be unique. A key can be inserted or deleted from a map but cannot be modified. Values assigned to keys can be changed. It is a great way for quickly accessing value using the key and it is done in O(1) time

# MultiMap

Multimap is similar to map with an addition that multiple elements can have same keys. Also, it is NOT required that the key value and mapped value pair has to be unique in this case. One important thing to note about multimap is that multimap keeps all the keys in sorted order always. These properties of multimap makes it very much useful in competitive programming.
